# Pathogen

> An airborne disease has spread across the lands, destroying any civilization in its path. All you ever loved is gone - but why? In an effort to find answers, and maybe even a cure, you scavenge the remnants of civlization for food and gear, in the struggle for survival.

Pathogen is a roguelike set in a procedurally-generated post-apocalyptic world.
