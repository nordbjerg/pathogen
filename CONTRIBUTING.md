# Contribute

Contributing to pathogen is simple.

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Create a pull request

# Guidelines

We ask of you to follow a few guidelines, or else we will _not_ accept your pull request.

* Keep your ``master`` branch clean. This makes it easy for you to pull the latest changes on our master branch into yours.
* Create a new branch for each new feature or set of related bug fixes.
* Never merge from your local branches into your ``master`` branch. Only update your ``master`` branch by pulling directly from this repository.

## Code style

We try to follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) as closely as possible for consistency.

## Doxygen Comments

Extensive documentation of classes and class members will make the code more readable to new contributors. Doxygen comments (new or rewritten ones) for existing functions and classes are welcomed.

Comments should adhere to the following guidelines

* Comments should describe behaviour towards the outside, not the implementation.
* Describe things that aren't obvious from just the name.
* Don't describe redudantly and don't describe obvious things.
* When documenting X, describe how X interacts with other components. This _may_ also need a description of the implementation of X.

# Pull Requests
